When I started this project, I decided to start by writing every syscall api and details about them. It helps with planning, scope and idea of how systems should interact and behave.
- 00-31: Process & Task Management
- 32-63: IPC
- 64-95: FIlesystem & I/O

- 128-159: Synchronisation

Its a very rough file.
